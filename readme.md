# Example Email Templates

Over the past summer, I learned a lot about how to build HTML emails, and boy was I in for a surprise. Apparently, emails are about 10 years behind browsers in some regards, specifically layouts. Divs don't always render as block elements, margin and padding are not real, and style elements only work some of the time. Well I got great news for you, I've taken some time to create an example template that is fairly well documented so you can see how to design a simple, attractive email message. It's not that hard at all, just fill in the template with your own information and then put it through Premailer, and it's ready to send!

This won't create those crazy email newsletters you get every month, but it will make a difference in how your users perceive your name, brand, or group when they don't get the normal email with 13px Arial.

## Instructions

1) Read through the template(s). Get an idea of how you have to lay things out in an email. Drop jaw over necessary use of tables for layout. 
2) Replace the dummy content with your own! Make it pretty, make it shine. You can design it in Chrome!
3) Run it through a style inlining program like Premailer. This really helps because many clients don't support the style tag.
4) Run your email through a testing service like Litmus. This will give you an idea of how your email looks to others.
