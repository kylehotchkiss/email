        		So you want to learn how to create HTML emails, huh? That's rather ambitious, I must say. It's enjoyable, but as it turns out, creating HTML emails is no walk in a park (or ordinary site build for that matter). It's a step backwards as far as layouts goes, but once you get familiar with table-based layouts again, you can pull it off with the same amount of elegance you would pull off on your normal projects!

        		I recently learned how to build email templates, and thought I would give you a hand by building a few and commenting them out nicely so you could understand what is going on. These are really elementary templates, it's up to you to make them work for your brand/company/self. I encourage you to learn the basics real quick and then blow your users away with elegantly designed messages!

        		I personally think Email is a beautiful system that doesn't need to be replaced - it just needs some progressive fixes for modern times. If we could get emails to be standardized to at least HTML4, we could really communicate to our end users much better. I think the best way to work towards standardization is to get more people taking advantage of well-designed HTML emails and then we're on our way.
